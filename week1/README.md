# What do Software Engineers/Data Scientists/AI Engineers/Prompt Engineers do?

Here's a ChatGPT summary that clarifies the distinction: https://chatgpt.com/share/687b387b-fdc4-800e-9c7a-dc7e4e7aeec5

# Setting up your environment

### Option 1: Using GitHub Codespaces

We went over GitHub Codespaces very briefly the other day. If you'd like more resources, you can look into [this (optional) guide]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/quickstart).

### Option 2: Using VS Code (working locally)

1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Assignments this week

Please watch/code along with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7) from [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g).
Aim to cover videos 2 - 7 in the series.

# Problem Set

Feel free to ask ChatGPT. But make sure you understand things thoroughly!

### Problem Set 1: Divisors

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

### Problem Set 2: List Less Than Ten

Take a list, say for example this one:  
> a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]  
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:
- Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
- Write this in one line of Python.
- Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

### Problem Set 3: List Remove Duplicates (Functions & Sets)

Write a program that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:
- This will require you to learn [lesson 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Os0o3wzS_I&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7&index=8).
- To solve this, you can write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.

# List of Shortcuts

> `CTRL + X`: Cut    
> `CTRL + C`: Copy  
> `CTRL + V`: Paste  
> `CTRL + Z`: Undo  
> `CTRL + Y`: Reverses Undo (`CTRL + Z`)   
> `CTRL + D`: In VSCode, this selects the word at the cursor, or the next occurrence of the current selection.
